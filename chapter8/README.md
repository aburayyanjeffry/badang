## 2. Install the Remote Desktop Client at Macbook
From my research, the best Remote Desktop Client at Macbook is from the one from Microsoft!!!. I'm just going to install it by using brew
```
brew install --cask microsoft-remote-desktop
```

## 3. Just do it
Fire up the application and cliek Add PC. Then just fill in the ip, user, password and you are all set.
