This journal chronicles the journey of a broken laptop given a second chance as a home laboratory. The laptop's hostname is badang, inspired by the mythical Malay character who gained extraordinary strength after drinking ghost vomit, symbolizing its transformation and new purpose.

## Introduction
In this journal, I document the process of repurposing a broken laptop into a home laboratory. This journey covers various aspects, from hardware setup to software installation useful for DevOps Engineers, as well as network configuration. I'm using Ubuntu 24.04 for badang. I hope the information here will be useful specifically for Ubuntu 24.04 users, and generally for all Linux users in their day-to-day operations and troubleshooting needs.

## Conclusion

Thank you for following along with this project. I hope you find the information helpful. Have a nice day
